    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p class="intro">I am a careered problem solver. I enjoy taking something that is broken or has great potential to be better and creating solutions for those problems. I am suited well working individually or in a team environment. However, when working alone I do get an itch for the collaboration, energy, and communication that a team or group environment provides. I have always enjoyed working hard, setting goals, and driving/ motivating the team to exceed those goals. Working hard and accomplishing goals comes with the benefit of being able to take the time to play equally as hard. For me play looks like watching my 2 daughters compete in gymnastics, vacationing with our family somewhere warm, or a myriad of other outdoor activities. </p>

      <h3>Troubleshooting & Repair</h3>
      <p>Initial professional experience troubleshooting was on fitness equipment, building mechanical, and building automation controls. As technology advanced my technological skills had to evolve, that is where I found an interest in design, code, and development. I love the idea of always learning with web developments ever evolving languages/tools. The idea of having to evolve with it to stay on the bleeding edge is what I find most stimulating.</p>

      <h3>Softball</h3>
      <p>I love being competative. Most of the time anymore my venue to for filling that desire to be competative is a softball diamond. I have been playing baseball all my life and over the last 6 or so years have transitioned to softball and look forward to playing when available.</p>
